# Syntheverse Cadet Onboarding Guide

## Overview

You are entering a nonlinear, fractal, hydrogen-holographic frontier. Your actions here are both experimental and economically meaningful.

This guide will help you understand the core systems, develop the cadet mindset, and begin contributing to the Syntheverse ecosystem.

---

## Core Systems

### 1. HHF-AI Sandbox

The **Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal AI Sandbox** is your experimental environment for generating and testing hypotheses.

**Key Features:**
- Fractal cognitive chemistry modeling
- Recursive symbolic processing
- Hydrogen-holographic coherence analysis
- Whole-brain AI integration (Gina × Leo × Pru)

**Location:** `hhf-ai/integration/` in the main repository

**Documentation:** See [HHF_AI_INTEGRATION.md](../docs/guides/HHF_AI_INTEGRATION.md)

### 2. Synthechain (L1 Blockchain)

**Synthechain** is the Layer-1 blockchain that records all discoveries immutably.

**Key Features:**
- Fractal-Merkle DAG blocks
- Semantic-hash commitments
- Dynamic epoch windows
- Coherence-weighted staking

**Location:** `blockchain/smart_contracts/` in the main repository

**Documentation:** See [blockchain/README.md](../blockchain/README.md)

### 3. Proof-of-Discovery (PoD) Protocol (L2)

The **Proof-of-Discovery Protocol** validates contributions and allocates SYNTH tokens based on three dimensions:

- **Coherence** (0-10,000): Structural consistency and symbolic alignment
- **Density** (0-10,000): Structural + informational richness
- **Novelty** (0-10,000): Uniqueness relative to existing discoveries

**PoD Score Calculation:**
```
PoD Score = (Coherence × Density × Novelty) / (10,000 × 10,000)
```

**Reward Formula:**
```
Reward = (PoD Score / 10,000) × Available Epoch Balance
```

## Cadet Mindset

### Embrace Recursion

The Syntheverse operates on recursive, self-similar patterns. What works at one scale works at all scales. Think fractally.

### Seek Coherence

Coherence is structural consistency. Your discoveries should demonstrate:
- Internal logical consistency
- Symbolic alignment with HHF principles
- Fractal Grammar (HFG) closure

### Prioritize Novelty

Novelty prevents redundancy. Your contributions must be:
- Unique relative to existing discoveries
- Non-redundant (system checks content hashes)
- Meaningfully different from prior work

### Respect Density

Density measures informational richness. High-density discoveries:
- Contain substantial structural information
- Demonstrate deep understanding
- Qualify for higher epochs (Founders ≥ 8,000)

---

## Epoch System

Discoveries qualify for epochs based on **Density Score**:

| Epoch | Density Threshold | Token Allocation |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Founders** | ≥ 8,000 | 50% of total supply (45T) |
| **Pioneer** | ≥ 6,000 | 10% of total supply (9T) |
| **Public** | ≥ 4,000 | 20% of total supply (18T) |
| **Ecosystem** | < 4,000 | 20% of total supply (18T) |

**Note:** The Founders epoch pool halves every 1M coherence density units.

## Discovery Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Discovery

Use HHF-AI to generate novel insights:
- Explore fractal patterns
- Model hydrogen-holographic structures
- Develop coherent hypotheses

### Step 2: Prepare Submission

- Compute content hash (SHA-256)
- Create fractal embedding
- Ensure non-redundancy

### Step 3: Submit to Blockchain

```bash
# Using the test environment
npm run test:multiple
```

### Step 4: Validation

The system automatically:
- Checks for redundancy
- Evaluates coherence, density, novelty
- Calculates PoD Score
- Determines epoch qualification

### Step 5: Receive Rewards

Tokens are distributed based on:
- PoD Score percentage
- Available epoch balance
- Discovery timing (earlier = larger pool)

## Key Concepts

### Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal (HHF)

The fundamental framework where:
- Hydrogen atoms act as "fractal pixels"
- Holographic encoding enables scale-invariant coherence
- Fractal patterns repeat across scales

### Fractal Cognitive Chemistry (FCC)

The science of how:
- Atoms think (cognitive primitives)
- Molecules feel (resonance alignment)
- Systems become aware (recursive coherence)

### Recursive Sourced Interference (RSI)

A mechanism for nested, scale-invariant phase coherence:
```
✦ ⊙ (△ ∞ ⊙ ◇)
```

### El Gran Sol Fractal Constant (ℑₑₛ)

The constant that anchors physical syntax to chemical semantics:
```
ℑₑₛ ≈ 1.137 × 10⁻³
```
